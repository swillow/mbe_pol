# mbe_pol (Many-Body Exansion with Polarization Energy)

MBE-pol is developed based on fragment-based method for quantum mechanics (QM) calculations on larger molecular systems and condensed phases as well. 

In mbe_pol, the potential energy of the system is defined as the sum of the potential energy of the second-order many-body expansion (MBE(2)) and the polarization energy: E = E_{MBE(2)} + E_{pol}
